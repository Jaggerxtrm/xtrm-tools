| **Session Flow** | both | Claim sync, stop gate, `xt end` reminder in worktrees |
| **Quality Gates** | both | Auto linting (ESLint, tsc, ruff, mypy) on file edits |
| **GitNexus** | Claude | Knowledge graph context for code exploration |
| **Service Skills** | Pi | Territory-based Docker service skill activation |

### Skills

| Skill | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `using-xtrm` | Global | Session operating manual |
| `documenting` | Global | SSOT documentation with drift detection |
| `delegating` | Global | Task delegation to cost-optimized agents |
| `orchestrating-agents` | Global | Multi-model collaboration |
| `using-quality-gates` | Global | Quality gate configuration and usage guide |
| `using-service-skills` | Global | Territory-based service skill activation |
| `creating-service-skills` | Global | Scaffold new service skills via Serena LSP deep dive |
| `scoping-service-skills` | Global | Define territory globs for service skill routing |

## Plugin Structure

```
plugins/xtrm-tools/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Manifest
├── hooks → ../../hooks           # All hook scripts + hooks.json
├── skills → ../../skills         # Auto-discovered skills
└── .mcp.json → ../../.mcp.json   # MCP servers
```

All hook paths use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` — works from any installation location.

---

## Policy System

Policies are the **single source of truth** for all enforcement rules. Located in `policies/`, they compile to both Claude hooks and Pi extensions.

### Policy Files

| Policy | Runtime | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `session-flow.json` | both | Claim sync, stop gate, `xt end` reminder |
| `beads.json` | both | Issue tracking gates |
| `quality-gates.json` | both | Linting/typechecking |
| `branch-state.json` | claude | Branch context injection |
| `gitnexus.json` | claude | Knowledge graph enrichment |
| `serena.json` | claude | Serena LSP workflow reminder |
| `service-skills.json` | pi | Territory-based skill activation |

### Compiler

```bash
node scripts/compile-policies.mjs           # Generate hooks.json
node scripts/compile-policies.mjs --check   # CI drift detection
```
